# Quality-Of-Life-Analysis-and-Visualization

This project, Canada's Quality of Life Framework: Insights Through Power BI, presents an interactive data visualization dashboard built using Power BI. It explores the various domains that shape the well-being of Canadians, including prosperity, health, society, environment, and good governance. Drawing on publicly available data from Statistics Canada, the dashboard offers a comprehensive look at how different factors impact quality of life across Canadian communities. Users can explore trends in life satisfaction, mental and physical health, social support networks, environmental satisfaction, transportation access, and public trust in institutions. The dashboard is designed to support data-driven analysis and policy insights, helping stakeholders identify strengths and areas for improvement in community well-being.
